Plastic pollution is the most visible example of the havoc we’re causing to our planet."
2,plastic,general,low,medium,"Here are some top tips to reduce your plastic waste:

Coffee cups
Carry a reusable coffee cup or flask."
3,plastic,general,low,medium,Almost all coffee outlets will refill reusable cups and some offer a discount.
4,plastic,general,low,medium,"Bring your own bottle
We produce 78 million tonnes of plastic globally but just 2% of this is made from recycled material (Ellen MacArthur Foundation)[3]."
5,plastic,general,low,medium,"This means common items like plastic bottles are produced from virgin plastic, used once and thrown away, at a cost to our planet."
6,plastic,general,low,medium,"Say no to plastic cutlery and straws
In England, single-use plastic plates and cutlery are set to be banned (The Guardian)[4]."
7,plastic,general,low,medium,"By carrying a spork, a spare fork from home, or your own mini-reusable set including reusable straw, you can help cut down on disposables which would have turned into ocean pollution."
8,plastic,general,low,medium,"Where possible, avoid straws completely, even if they’re made from paper, as this reduces the need for resources to produce and dispose of them."
9,plastic,general,low,medium,"This allows reusable crockery to be used, removes packaging for lunch options, and reduces waste as reusables will be washed afterwards."
10,plastic,general,low,medium,"Alternatively, if you do need to get food to-go, could you bring your own container to a local café, sandwich shop, or food stall?"
11,plastic,general,low,medium,"By asking businesses to refill your container, you save them money and save the planet from disposable plastic!"
12,plastic,general,low,medium,"Some businesses will reward customers with a discount for bringing their own reusable lunch container, so always check with the owner."
13,plastic,general,low,medium,"Ditch the cling wrap
Unlike cling film that cannot be recycled, consider alternatives such as aluminium foil which can be recycled."
14,plastic,general,low,medium,"If you are using foil, make sure you clean it and put it in the recycling bin after use."
15,plastic,general,low,medium,"Made using 100% cotton, pine resin, jojoba oil and various waxes they are a reusable and sustainable alternative to cling film, and no nasties will leach into your food while it’s stored."
16,plastic,general,low,medium,"Teabags
Some teabags contain hidden plastics such as glues used to seal the bags, in the fabric of the bag itself, or in the packaging."
17,plastic,general,low,medium,"Always check what you can put in your food bin where you live, using your council website."
18,plastic,general,low,medium,"To avoid these plastics, try loose leaf tea which can be used with a strainer, or reusable teabags."
19,plastic,general,low,medium,"Alternatively, look for brands that are taking action to remove plastic from their tea – try bags that are unbleached and organic, in cardboard packaging."
20,plastic,general,low,medium,"Give up gum
In England, around 87% of streets are stained with gum (Keep Britain Tidy)[6] so always make sure you dispose of chewing gum in an appropriate bin, never on the floor."
21,plastic,general,low,medium,This makes it take longer to decompose and it will break down into microplastics.
22,plastic,general,low,medium,"There is no legal limit on how long it takes to decompose in the natural environment before it is called ‘biodegradable’, so many of the biodegradable glitters could last as long as plastic."
23,plastic,general,low,medium,"Instead, steer clear of all glitter and opt for alternative decorations instead."
24,plastic,general,low,medium,"Bring back the milkman
Consider getting your milk delivered in glass bottles, which are reused and recycled instead of your usual plastic pint."
25,plastic,general,low,medium,"More and more of us are making the switch to have milk and other items, like fruit juices, eggs and bread, delivered by a milkman without the plastic packaging."
26,plastic,general,low,medium,"Keep plastics in use for longer
Going plastic-free has its positives and negatives."
27,plastic,general,low,medium,"Plastic weighs less than glass so can reduce transport emissions, but glass is more widely recycled and contains a higher portion of recycled content which can reduce its impact on resource consumption globally."
28,plastic,general,low,medium,"For example, when a plastic bottle finishes, try your local refill shop and fill those containers with new products including wet and dry goods."
29,plastic,general,low,medium,"We can also reuse containers like old butter and ice cream tubs as sandwich boxes, useful tubs for screws or nails, or planters for seedlings."
30,plastic,general,low,medium,"Start simple
And if it’s too daunting to know where to start, try making one small change and committing to it."
31,plastic,general,low,medium,"When you’re finished, wash it out and reuse it, refill it, or recycle it appropriate"
